Messi obviously one of the best players of all time but in no way was Messi better than Haaland last season. Outside of the WC Messi was outshined by Mbappe within the same league and he got dogwalked by Bayern in the UCL. If Messi went to the premier league and in his very first season broke the prem goal record, was top scorer in the UCL and went ahead and won the clubs first ever treble then he would have won the Ballon D’or regardless of whatever happened in the WC. The people calling for him to win the award now will still be wanting him to win it then. Let’s face it the award is massively biased and is nothing more than a popularity contest. Messi and others have robbed people in the past and they’ll continue to do so in the future.",Reddit

Lewandowski had an amazing year. But unfortunately for lewa fans, Messi outperformed him this year.   Here's why:  **Winning Copa America**  No matter who you are, you've got to appreciate what Messi has done for his country this year. And you've got to feel happy for the man. This guy just deserved it. Here are the pointers:  * Ended a 28 year trophy drought for his country* Player of the Tournament* Top Goal scorer* Top Assist provider* Absolutely killed it. Seriously the guy was so good. One of the best performances at international level if not the best.   **Winning Cop del Rey**  This is something a lot of people are neglecting. Copa del Rey is pretty competitive. It's not a very easy trophy. But Messi won it!   But here's the part what in my opinion is **the biggest reason** why he deserves it.   Barca are a mess right now without Messi. Lat year, they one the Copa del Rey, and this year Barca isnt even able to qualify for the the Knockout stage of the champions league!!!   This just shows how much Messi carried Barca last year and took them to great heights.   >!Yes I know there was also Griezmann who left the club, but lets be honest. If you watched the games you know much he was involved. !<  **Stat Sheet**  A lot of people are using the stats to prove that Lewa deserved it. But they are just calculating the G/A.   If that were the deciding factor, our man, Leo would have won like 9 golden balls!   Please compare the Stat sheet. Messi leads in every category except Goals scored. >!Ignore Benzema here guys.

It's hard to compare 2 players.  Overall one may say Messi had a better career than Maradona. More goals, more personal and team titles, Messi was also more professional, much more consistent, he didn't do stupid stuff like Maradona, like drugs, fights, parties, lack of discipline and so on.&#x200B;But for me peak Maradona was a beast. In 1986 WC he was simply taking opponent teams apart on his own, dribbling past 3-4 players and scoring goals or creating chances.Peak Messi was a great  player too. I really liked the young Messi, at age 18-21, when he was also very fast and strong, and could terrorize whole defense on his own. But in his mid 20's his game changed. He became slower, and focused primarily on scoring goals from chances created by Barca team play. Usually in big matches he was easily neutralized, he didn't carry the team. Like against Inter in 2010 semis, or Chelsea 2009 and 2012 semis, he did practically nothing, he was neutralized pretty easily. So if Barca shined then Messi also shined, but if Barca had troubles than Messi would disappear.Same for World Cups. In 2014 I don't remember him being pivotal in any of the important matches. His performance in 2014 was a far cry from Maradona's 86 performance, where the guy literally dribbled past everybody like in PlayStation game.So for me Maradona was something else.",Reddit

Since then its slowly declined in terms of talent for whatever reason. It seems like club football has risen in that time period, which is why this is a good time to make a revamped club world cup. I honestly believe that as long as the prize money isnt a rip off then teams all over will take this very seriously. Small teams definetly do take the current CWC seriously, with the new format we will see European teams do the same im sure of it. The mere fact that its every 4 years will make it huge. Im genuinely upset that Liverpool will not be involved in it.I believe this will become a global spectacle and well see everybody talking about it. I think the oppurtunity for non European teams to show off their skills will get people excited. As an American ill be very excited to see Seatlle sounders represent the usa, and im sure people from other countries will be very excited to see their own nations represented. You just know that any time a European club gets knocked out by somebody itll be an earthquake of excitement.

Both of them have an outstanding club career, in that regard no one in history can match their club success. Sadly they didn't deliver in the International level for a long period, and that has been a big a stain in their resumé. Such as I have considered both of them to be out of the top 5 of all time. But now finally we have a Messi performance in the World Cup. He is carrying Argentina 🇦🇷 to the triumph. He is their tactical leader as always, but this time for the first time he is their mental leader as well. Everybody in the team is focused, because Messi is making them believe in the Win. He usually lacked the maturity to make the team follow him. He has been a burden in 2018 for example, because he was weak mentally, visible stressed and visible scared of the World Cup. The same burden that Portugal 🇵🇹 suffered from Ronaldo during this World Cup. (Keep in mind that I have favored Ronaldo in the Messi/Ronaldo debate up till prior this World Cup).    Messi's greatness doesn't stop at mentally helping and focusing the team, but he has inspired a whole nation and maybe more to fly across half of the globe to support him and his team in such numbers that whenever Argentina 🇦🇷 plays it feels like they are playing at home. At this point, even if they lose in the final Messi should be regarded as the greatest of all time, period. Better than Pelé, better than Maradona, better than Zidane, better than Ronaldo the brazilian, better than Cruyff. He has achieved everything at club level and exceeded everything that others have done. Only one thing was missing, a big performance in the biggest stage of all, the World Cup, to be more precise, a Messi performance at the tough stages of the World Cup. To elevate his team tactically and mentally. He did it in this World Cup. In 2014 he wasn't doing what he is doing today.   Bottom line for me: Messi is the Undisputed Greatest Player of All Time, and we don't need to wait Sunday to say it. He is the GOAT today.",Reddit
36,Why does everyone hate england in football?,chaos_birb6,2023/08/24,https://www.reddit.com//r/football/comments/1600cix/why_does_everyone_hate_england_in_football/,"i wasn't aware of this at all growing up, but during my time on the internet i've found that almost everyone who's not from here hates us, even when there's not an established footballing rivalry between us and their respective countries like there is with germany and argentina. I've seen some pretty stupid things being said by people, e.g. ""i love seeing the pain and suffering of english fans"", ""if england won an international competition it would ruin the entire sport"", ""english people don't know how to play football"", etc etc, and also people pointing out obvious injustices against england (prime example would be the hand of god) as ""legendary moments in football's history"".Why? We've only won one trophy ever and barely had any success or luck, so what's everyone's problem with us? Football was invented in england and we're home to the oldest football league in the world, so you're wrong if you think england winning a trophy will be bad for the sport.

37,Why do English football fans like to diss Scottish football so much?,curlywurrly,2024/01/07,https://www.reddit.com//r/football/comments/190pcib/why_do_english_football_fans_like_to_diss/,"I saw the video of an English journalist asking Ange Postecoglou if he could 'visualise winning trophies' (as if none of his previous trophies counted) and then read the comments, which were filled with people dissing Scottish football, so I wondered why a lot of English football fans feel the need to do this.Obviously everyone is entitled to their opinion, but us Scottish fans know the standard isn't as good as the English Premier League, but we don't care, so what do you get out of telling us so?It's like a kid born into a rich family who goes to Eton slagging off a kid who goes to public school for not getting the same standard of education. Do you not realise how elitist it sounds?The thing is though, apart from Liverpool and Man Utd, most of your clubs would struggle to even finish 3rd in Scotland (if you had the same budgets as us, of course).Here's a few facts about our 'famers' league':- Scotland has the highest attendances in Europe per capita.- Ibrox holds the record for the largest league attendance in Britain.- Ibrox and Celtic Park were voted 1st and 2nd out of 100 by Four Four Two magazine for the best stadiums in Britain.- Hampden holds the record for the largest international attendance in Britain.- The highest UEFA club attendance ever was at Hampden.- In the last 4 seasons Scottish clubs have beaten: Porto, Galatasaray, Dortmund, Feyenoord, Lazio, Leipzig, PSV, Betis, AZ Alkmaar, Red Star, Braga, Rennes, Frankfurt, and Rosenborg (a list that most English teams would be proud of).I'm not slagging English football, I'm sure most Scots support the British clubs in Europe, but the next time you think your 'nan could win the league in Scotland', please give us a break and remember many English players and managers (as well as other top internationals) have come up here and either struggled or failed completely.Also, we've all seen the videos of the crap atmospheres at Anfield, Old Trafford, Tottenham and Man City lately, and at least we still don't have half 'n' half scarves for tourists, and most of us are glad our clubs haven't sold out to oil money and the Super League.Please don't take this as anti-English or any of that pish, I'm just trying to highlight how much of a bratty Eton schoolboy you sound when you feel the need to tell us how bad our game is. We already know and we don't care what you think about it. 👍🤣",Reddit

39,Why Haaland deserves the ballon d’or way more than Messi,OakeyCat,2023/07/11,https://www.reddit.com//r/football/comments/14wci2w/why_haaland_deserves_the_ballon_dor_way_more_than/,"The 2023 ballon d’or has 2 main candidates to win it, Lionel Messi and Erling Haaland. And if you think that Messi deserves it more than Haaland, you must be a  Messi fan.Firstly, let’s look at achievements. Messi had a great season at PSG, winning Ligue 1 and getting a plethora of goals and assists. He also won throphee des champions with PSG. But lets just remember, this is the French league, widely considered to be a farmers league and these achievements would put Messi nowhere near the competition to win the ballon d’or. However, the main (and, to be fair, only) reason that Messi is the number one candidate is his World Cup win. Messi carried Argentina to win both the World Cup and the golden ball (given to the best player of the tournament). This was no doubt a highlight of Messi’s career, but should I entirely change the course of the ballon d’or? On the other hand, Haaland has definitely had a far better season than Messi. He broke the premier league goal scoring record, scoring the most goals in one season ever (in the PL). On top of this, he carried city to win the fa cup, premier league and (for the first time in history for city) the champions league, claiming the golden boot in all of these competitions. This was all done in his first season btw. And on top of all this, he won the award for the best player in the premier league in the 22/23 season. To me, there is no competition here, Haaland has had a better season and has accomplished much more than Messi. The only other argument against Haalands ballon d’or win is his performance in the semi finals and finals of big competitions, failing to  score in these finals. But this doesn’t mean he played bad. Haaland created chances, applied pressure and was an incredible driving force in cities victories in these finals. Messi, on the other hand, had a stellar performance in the World Cup semiS and the final, scoring 3 goals and getting an assist. Whilst Messi do doubt had a better performance in the big games of big competitions, I still believe Haaland should win the ballon dor as he played in and helped his team to win both the biggest competition in Europe and the biggest tournament in England whereas Messi only played in the world cup and was nowhere to be found in the champions league. Overall, although Messi has had an unbelievable season and won the World Cup, the shouldn’t be the main factor in overruling haalands spectacular season and various achievements. Although this may just be my opinion, I think it should be obvious to use all that Haaland should win the ballon dor, and if Messi wins, we can truly rule out the people and reporters deciding as bias.",Reddit
40,"""Pele can't be the best because he didn't play in Europe""",diegoles7,2023/01/11,https://www.reddit.com//r/football/comments/1097a40/pele_cant_be_the_best_because_he_didnt_play_in/,"We have always heard/read that phrase and it is almost never contextualised. I clarify that the intention of this post is not to put Pelé as the number 1 but to destroy all those pseudo-arguments that people who don't know about football usually say. Of course there are plenty of arguments to argue that Pelé is the best player in history, as there are for some others, but that's not the idea of the post.In Pele's time, unlike today, it was not so common for South American players to go and play in Europe, there was still no Bosman law, so the best players from South America stayed in their respective leagues. Of course, there were some South Americans who played in Europe, but they were rare exceptions. The difference between the South American and European leagues was not as great as it is today. In fact, between 1958 and 1970, Brazil won 3 World Cups, that is to say, 3 out of 4. And all their players played in the Brazilian league. Moreover, the Brazilian league also had defenders like the Chilean Elías Figueroa, one of the best in his position at the time and always praised by Beckenbauer.The Intercontinental of the time was won mainly by South Americans and, in fact, Pelé won two, one against Eusebio's Benfica and the other against Milan. In addition, Santos toured Europe and smashed the Europeans with Pelé starring in the matches, scoring goals of all colours. It is true that they were friendlies, but at that time friendlies did not have the same meaning as they do now. Nowadays friendlies are used to test players in most cases, in those days they were not. They were played with a lot of rigour, as if it were an official match. Besides, everyone wanted to beat Santos, who at that time were the best team in the world. So there wasn't much difference between playing in Europe and playing in South America.Another pseudo-argument I want to destroy. Well, it's not even a pseudo-argument, it's a lie, it's a fallacy... I've read a lot of people saying that in Pele's time there was no such thing as offside. This is something that really pisses me off. Offside is more than 100 years old and in Pele's time it was even stricter, because if the blue team player was on the same line as the red team player, it was considered offside, nowadays that is not offside. Imagine how many more goals Pele would have scored with today's offside rule. And instead of giving him more credit, the opposite happens, they make fun of him saying that he counts the goals he scored at school. Counting friendlies he scored more than 1000 goals (many of them to Europeans). Officially he scored more than 700, now I don't have the exact figure. The fact is that he scored a lot of goals.Obviously, like everything in life, football has evolved, nowadays it is more tactical and so on, but you also have to take into account that in Pele's time there were not all those facilities that footballers have today. The ball in his time was heavy, as were the boots, the grass... Well, in many cases there wasn't even grass, they played on a muddy pitch. And another thing, there were no cards, in fact cards only existed after the 66 World Cup, when Pelé got injured. It wasn't until the 1970 World Cup that cards were introduced. Today, on the other hand, talented players are looked after, while Pelé was kicked to death, taking advantage of the fact that there were no cards. And even with all that going against him, Pelé was by far the best player in the world at the time.The post as I said at the beginning is not intended to put Pele as the number 1 in history, that in the end ends up being a matter of taste. I simply wanted to give him the credit he deserves. PS: Sorry if I have made any mistakes in the English translation.",Reddit

I've got myself in a spot of bother with the wife. This is a bit of a long story, so bare with me. I love football, before I met my wife I'd watch it all the time, mostly Premier League, Championship but lots of European football as well, African Cup of Nations when it's on, J-League, MLS, A-League, Chinese Super League, literally anything. My wife is not so keen, when we first lived together she was not happy with how much time I spent watching football on TV or the internet and demanded I cut down. It all came to a bit of a head during the Euros and we reached an agreement and I'm now at about 5 matches a week, which I guess is fair enough. She is important too.However, for a World Cup, I don't want to miss anything, I want to watch literally every match, either live or replay it later in the day. So one night, a few months back, I mentioned this to her and we agreed that I could, as long as I take her on holiday to whichever country wins the tournament. At this point I was probably a bit drunk and fairly confident England would win it. I was thinking great, we'll go have a weekend in Manchester, do some shopping, go to some nice bars and go watch one of the best teams in the world while we're there. Perfect.She starts getting into it, even watching matches and she's proper cheering on distant, exotic countries like Brazil, Japan, Australia. She's thinking big, we've not had a holiday since we married because of Covid and whatever. I'm still very much banking on a cheaper holiday in England, but then, obviously, England got knocked out and we're left with 4 teams in the semis:France - This is probably the best case scenario. She's mentioned Paris before and we can hop on the Eurostar or whatever. Should be nice, not going to cost me a bomb and I can probably go to Parc de Princes too.Croatia - Not too keen. I went there on a stag weekend a few years ago and it wasn't great. At least there's Dinamo Zagreb are some nice beaches but she'll probably want to drag me round Game of Thrones places.Morocco - I've heard good things about the food. I've not really looked into it but I'm not sure there would be that much to do and I imagine it would be way too hot. On the plus side, I imagine it would be relatively cheap.Argentina - This doesn't really bare thinking about, in terms of cost. At least I could probably go see some matches in Buenos Aries, there's supposed to be 24 professional teams in one city, which is pretty awesome, could visit each of the grounds.Of course, now it's between France and Argentina. My wife mentioned a week in Monaco the other day but I remembered some legal challenge, looked it up and was able to tell her Monaco isn't France and she seemed interested in the Paris option. She's started looking at Argentina and is thinking Buenos Aries, ranches, waterfalls, maybe go down to the very South to see some penguins. Trip of a lifetime sort of stuff but nothing I'm really interested in besides the football. I have no plan to back out though and I'm sure wherever we go, it will be a lot of fun for both of us, but my bank account and I will definitely be cheering on France!Throwaway account.",Reddit

Think mbappe is a good player don’t get me wrong, but personally without the speed / pace he isn’t all that special. I see chance after chance with that front three and mbappe misses chances that top scorers wouldn’t normally miss. He’s fairly good on the ball and finishing is decent but I feel like most of his goals are coming from him just being able to run into free space and create an opportunity. Obviously that’s a skill in itself so he’s still a top player but I’m putting his main ability as his insane pace. What do you guys think? Side note - not a religious football fan and don’t watch PSG games unless it’s champions league(do watch their highlights). I keep up to date with football and watch prem games and I think there’s far better strikers atm but all the hype is on mbappe. (Can’t lie I am a bit of a haaland fan though!)Edit - the whole point was to ask people with probably better knowledge of PSG who actually watch them play. I’ve acknowledged that he has incredible pace and he obviously utilises it, but the point is everyone acts like he’s world class and the next best thing but in reality if he loses that pace due to age / injury what has he got left? His dribbling and finishing is good but not incredible and he misses chances a world class player wouldn’t miss. Basically I think he’s overrated and wanted opinions from people who watch him play for 90 mins - like I said I don’t 🤷‍♂️",Reddit

However, the foot-mounted inertialnavigation relies largely on the aid of Zero Velocity Update (ZUPT) and hasencountered inherent problems such as heading drift. This paper implements apedestrian navigation system based on dual foot-mounted low-cost inertialmeasurement units (IMU) and inter-foot ultrasonic ranging. The observabilityanalysis of the system is performed to investigate the roles of the ZUPTmeasurement and the foot-to-foot ranging measurement in improving the stateestimability. A Kalman-based estimation algorithm is mechanized in the Earthframe, rather than in the common local-level frame, which is found to beeffective in depressing the linearization error in Kalman filtering. Anellipsoid constraint in the Earth frame is also proposed to further restrictthe height drift. Simulation and real field experiments show that the proposedmethod has better robustness and positioning accuracy (about 0.1-0.2% travelleddistance) than the traditional pedestrian navigation schemes do.",Arxiv

Theplantar pressure measurement system was used to measure and record thesubjects' successive natural gaits. Two indices were proposed: distribution ofvertical ground reaction force (VGRF) of plantar and the rate of the footprintareas.

In Experiment 1 (n = 10), somatosensation from the footand the ankle was degraded by standing on a foam surface. In Experiment 2 (n =10), somatosensation from the foot and ankle was facilitated through theincreased cutaneous feedback at the foot and ankle provided by strips ofathletic tape applied across both ankle joints. The centre of foot pressuredisplacements (CoP) were recorded using a force platform. The results showedthat (1) trunk extensor muscles fatigue increased CoP displacements undernormal somatosensatory conditions (Experiment 1 and Experiment 2), (2) thisdestabilizing effect was exacerbated when somatosensation from the foot and theankle was degraded (Experiment 1), and (3) this destabilizing effect wasmitigated when somatosensation from the foot and the ankle was facilitated(Experiment 2).

Our understanding of therelationship between the failures of them remains incomplete. We sought toimprove this understanding through computational modeling of force in thesesoft tissues. The impact of PTT and ligament tears on force changes in theremaining ligaments was investigated using a previously validated finiteelement model of the foot. The ability of the PTT to restore foot alignment ina collapsed foot was evaluated by increasing the PTT force in a foot withattenuated ligaments and comparing the alignment angles to the intact foot.Rupture of any one of the ligaments led to overloading the remaining ligaments,except for the plantar naviculocuneiform, first plantar tarsometatarsal, andspring ligaments, where removing one led to unloading the other two. Theattenuation of the plantar fascia, long plantar, short plantar, and springligaments significantly overloaded the deltoid and talocalcaneal ligaments.Isolated PTT rupture had no effect on foot alignment, but did increase theforce in the deltoid and spring ligaments. Increasing the force within the PTTto 30% of body weight was effective at restoring foot alignment during quietstance, primarily through reducing hindfoot valgus and forefoot abduction asopposed to improving arch height. The attenuation of any one ligament oftenleads to overload of the remaining ligaments which may lead to progressivedegeneration. The PTT can maintain alignment in the collapsing foot, but at anincreased load which could lead to its injury. Early intervention, in the formof ligament repair or reconstruction, might be used to prevent the progressionof deformity. Moreover, strengthening the PTT through therapeutic exercisemight improve its ability to restore foot alignment.",Arxiv

In thispaper, we manage to bring both aspects of adaptive behavior to quadrupedlocomotion by combining RL and MPC while improving the robustness and agilityof blind legged locomotion. This integration leverages MPC's strength inpredictive capabilities and RL's adeptness in drawing from past experiences.Unlike traditional locomotion controls that separate stance foot control andswing foot trajectory, our innovative approach unifies them, addressing theirlack of synchronization. At the heart of our contribution is the synthesis ofstance foot control with swing foot reflection, improving agility androbustness in locomotion with adaptive behavior. A hallmark of our approach isrobust blind stair climbing through swing foot reflection. Moreover, weintentionally designed the learning module as a general plugin for differentrobot platforms. We trained the policy and implemented our approach on theUnitree A1 robot, achieving impressive results: a peak turn rate of 8.5 rad/s,a peak running speed of 3 m/s, and steering at a speed of 2.5 m/s. Remarkably,this framework also allows the robot to maintain stable locomotion whilebearing an unexpected load of 10 kg, or 83\% of its body mass.

In most robotic flexible endoscopic systems, theendoscope and instruments are controlled separately by two operators, which mayresult in communication errors and inefficient operation. We present a novelteleoperation robotic endoscopic system that can be commanded by a surgeonalone. This 13 degrees-of-freedom (DoF) system integrates a foot-controlledrobotic flexible endoscope and two hand-controlled robotic endoscopicinstruments (a robotic grasper and a robotic cauterizing hook). Afoot-controlled human-machine interface maps the natural foot gestures to the4-DoF movements of the endoscope, and two hand-controlled interfaces map themovements of the two hands to the two instruments individually. The proposedrobotic system was validated in an ex-vivo experiment carried out by sixsubjects, where foot control was also compared with a sequential clutch-basedhand control scheme. The participants could successfully teleoperate theendoscope and the two instruments to cut the tissues at scattered target areasin a porcine stomach. Foot control yielded 43.7% faster task completion andrequired less mental effort as compared to the clutch-based hand controlscheme. The system introduced in this paper is intuitive for three-limbmanipulation even for operators without experience of handling the endoscopeand robotic instruments. This three-limb teleoperated robotic system enablesone surgeon to intuitively control three endoscopic tools which normallyrequire two operators, leading to reduced manpower, less communication errors,and improved efficiency.",Arxiv

The bubble first collapsed and then reformed ata similar height, finally, it started to oscillate for a long time. We findthat the collapsing and oscillation of the bubble boundary were tightlyassociated with a flare-like feature located at the bottom of the bubble. Basedon the observational results, we propose that the prominence should be composedof an overlying horizontal spine encircling a low-lying horizontal and avertical foot, in which the horizontal foot was consisted of shorter fieldlines running partially along the spine and with the both ends connecting tothe solar surface, while the vertical foot was consisted of piling-up dips dueto the sagging of the spine fields and supported by a bipolar magnetic systemformed by parasitic polarities (i.e., the bubble). The upflows in the verticalfoot were possibly caused by the magnetic reconnection at the separator betweenthe bubble and the overlying dips, which intruded into the persistent downflowfield and formed the picture of counter-streaming mass flows. In addition, thecounter-streaming flows in the horizontal foot were possibly caused by theimbalanced pressure at the both ends.",Arxiv

The stiff and propulsive human foot hastwo distinct arches, the longitudinal and transverse. By contrast, the feet ofnon-human primates are flat and softer. Current understanding of foot stiffnessis based on studies that focus solely on the longitudinal arch, and little isknown about the mechanical function of the transverse arch. However, commonexperience suggests that transverse curvature dominates the stiffness; adrooping dollar bill stiffens significantly upon curling it along thetransverse direction, not the longitudinal. We derive a normalized curvatureparameter that encapsulates the geometric principle underlying the transversecurvature-induced stiffness. We show that the transverse arch accounts foralmost all the difference in stiffness between human and monkey feet (vervetmonkeys and pig-tailed macaques) by comparing transverse curvature-basedpredictions against published data on foot stiffness. Using this functionalinterpretation of the transverse arch, we trace the evolution of hominin feetand show that a human-like stiff foot likely predates Homo by $\sim 1.5$million years, and appears in the $\sim 3.4$ million year old fossil fromBurtele. A distinctly human-like transverse arch is also present in earlymembers of Homo, including Homo naledi, Homo habilis, and Homo erectus.However, the $\sim 3.2$ million year old Australopithecus afarensis isestimated to have possessed a transitional foot, softer than humans and stifferthan other extant primates.

To ensure smooth landing of theswing foot on surfaces with height uncertainty, the preplanned trajectories inthe task space should be adapted. The proposed adaptation algorithm consists oftwo stages. In the first stage, once the swing foot reaches its maximum height,the supervisory control is initiated until the touch is detected. After thedetection, the trajectories in the task space are modified to guarantee smoothlanding. In the second stage, this modification is preserved during the DoubleSupport Phase (DSP), and released in the next Single Support Phase (SSP).Effectiveness of the proposed online adaptation algorithm is experimentallyverified through realization of the walking patterns on the SURENA III humanoidrobot, designed and fabricated at CAST.

The TTA is hypothesized to increase stiffnessthrough a cross-axis coupling between transverse tissue stiffness andlongitudinal midfoot stiffness. However, we currently lack in vivo tests ofthis hypothesis. Such tests are crucial because muscle contraction considerablymodulates MLA function and may also affect the TTA's predicted cross-axiscoupling. Here we show in vivo evidence for substantial cross-axis coupling instanding human subjects. We found that longitudinal midfoot bending stiffnessincreased upon increasing transverse forefoot stiffness using an elastic tape(mean$\pm$standard error = $76\% \pm 19\%$, p=0.0002), thus supporting the TTAhypothesis.

Through muscular contraction andexpansion of their foot, they transmit waves of shear stress through a thinlayer of mucus onto a solid substrate. Since a free surface cannot supportshear stress, adhesive locomotion is not a viable propulsion mechanism forwater snails that travel inverted beneath the free surface. Nevertheless, themotion of the freshwater snail, Sorbeoconcha physidae, is reminiscent of thatof its terrestrial counterparts, being generated by the undulation of the snailfoot that is separated from the free surface by a thin layer of mucus. Here, alubrication model is used to describe the mucus flow in the limit of smallamplitude interfacial deformations. By assuming the shape of the snail foot tobe a traveling sine wave and the mucus to be Newtonian, an evolution equationfor the interface shape is obtained and the resulting propulsive force on thesnail is calculated. This propulsive force is found to be non-zero for moderatevalues of Capillary number but vanishes in the limits of high and low Capillarynumbers. Physically, this force arises because the snail's foot deforms thefree surface, thereby generating curvature pressures and lubrication flowsinside the mucus layer that couple to the topography of the foot.",Arxiv

Nevertheless, we find evidence of nonlinear wave activity inthe prominence foot by examining the relative magnitude of the fluctuationintensity ($\delta I/I\sim \delta n/n$). The waves are evident as significantdensity fluctuations that vary with height, and apparently travel upward fromthe chromosphere into the prominence material with quasi-periodic fluctuationswith typical period in the range of 5-11 minutes, and wavelengths $\sim <$2000km. Recent Doppler shift observations show the transverse displacement of thepropagating waves. The magnetic field was measured with THEMIS instrument andwas found to be 5-14 G. For the typical prominence density the correspondingfast magnetosonic speed is $\sim$20 km s$^{-1}$, in qualitative agreement withthe propagation speed of the detected waves. The 2.5D MHD numerical model isconstrained with the typical parameters of the prominence waves seen inobservations. Our numerical results reproduce the nonlinear fast magnetosonicwaves and provide strong support for the presence of these waves in theprominence foot. We also explore gravitational MHD oscillations of the heavyprominence foot material supported by dipped magnetic field structure.",Arxiv

Current clinical approaches to DFUtreatment rely on patient and clinician vigilance, which has significantlimitations such as the high cost involved in the diagnosis, treatment andlengthy care of the DFU. We collected an extensive dataset of foot images,which contain DFU from different patients.

Deep learning-based methods, and in particular convolutionalneural networks (CNNs), have shown excellent performance for various tasks inmedical image analysis including medical image segmentation.  In this paper, we propose an ensemble approach based on twoencoder-decoder-based CNN models, namely LinkNet and U-Net, to perform footulcer segmentation.

To boost the segmentation performance, weincorporate five-fold cross-validation, test time augmentation and resultfusion.  Applied on the publicly available chronic wound dataset and the MICCAI 2021Foot Ulcer Segmentation (FUSeg) Challenge, our method achieves state-of-the-artperformance with data-based Dice scores of 92.07% and 88.80%, respectively, andis the top ranked method in the FUSeg challenge leaderboard.

With foot diameters down to a few tens ofnanometers, the investigated nanowires are promising candidates forultra-flexible and ultra-sensitive nanomechanical devices.",Arxiv

One such indication isthe radial acceleration relation, which is a tight correlation between themeasured gravitational acceleration and that expected from the baryons. We showhere that the dark matter density profile that has been motivated bydissipative dark matter models, including mirror dark matter, can reproducethis radial acceleration relation.",Arxiv
153,A CoGeNT confirmation of the DAMA signal,R. Foot,2010/04/08,http://arxiv.org/abs/1004.1424v2,The CoGeNT collaboration has recently reported a rising low energy spectrumin their ultra low noise germanium detector. This is particularly interestingas the energy range probed by CoGeNT overlaps with the energy region in whichDAMA has observed their annual modulation signal. We show that the mirror darkmatter candidate can simultaneously explain both the DAMA annual modulationsignal and the rising low energy spectrum observed by CoGeNT. This constitutesa model dependent confirmation of the DAMA signal and adds weight to the mirrordark matter paradigm.,Arxiv
