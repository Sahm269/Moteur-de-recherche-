Messi obviously one of the best players of all time but in no way was Messi better than Haaland last season. Outside of the WC Messi was outshined by Mbappe within the same league and he got dogwalked by Bayern in the UCL. If Messi went to the premier league and in his very first season broke the prem goal record, was top scorer in the UCL and went ahead and won the clubs first ever treble then he would have won the Ballon D’or regardless of whatever happened in the WC. The people calling for him to win the award now will still be wanting him to win it then. Let’s face it the award is massively biased and is nothing more than a popularity contest. Messi and others have robbed people in the past and they’ll continue to do so in the future.",Reddit

Lewandowski had an amazing year. But unfortunately for lewa fans, Messi outperformed him this year.   Here's why:  **Winning Copa America**  No matter who you are, you've got to appreciate what Messi has done for his country this year. And you've got to feel happy for the man. This guy just deserved it. Here are the pointers:  * Ended a 28 year trophy drought for his country* Player of the Tournament* Top Goal scorer* Top Assist provider* Absolutely killed it. Seriously the guy was so good. One of the best performances at international level if not the best.   **Winning Cop del Rey**  This is something a lot of people are neglecting. Copa del Rey is pretty competitive. It's not a very easy trophy. But Messi won it!   But here's the part what in my opinion is **the biggest reason** why he deserves it.   Barca are a mess right now without Messi. Lat year, they one the Copa del Rey, and this year Barca isnt even able to qualify for the the Knockout stage of the champions league!!!   This just shows how much Messi carried Barca last year and took them to great heights.   >!Yes I know there was also Griezmann who left the club, but lets be honest. If you watched the games you know much he was involved. !<  **Stat Sheet**  A lot of people are using the stats to prove that Lewa deserved it. But they are just calculating the G/A.   If that were the deciding factor, our man, Leo would have won like 9 golden balls!   Please compare the Stat sheet. Messi leads in every category except Goals scored. >!Ignore Benzema here guys.

It's hard to compare 2 players.  Overall one may say Messi had a better career than Maradona. More goals, more personal and team titles, Messi was also more professional, much more consistent, he didn't do stupid stuff like Maradona, like drugs, fights, parties, lack of discipline and so on.&#x200B;But for me peak Maradona was a beast. In 1986 WC he was simply taking opponent teams apart on his own, dribbling past 3-4 players and scoring goals or creating chances.Peak Messi was a great  player too. I really liked the young Messi, at age 18-21, when he was also very fast and strong, and could terrorize whole defense on his own. But in his mid 20's his game changed. He became slower, and focused primarily on scoring goals from chances created by Barca team play. Usually in big matches he was easily neutralized, he didn't carry the team. Like against Inter in 2010 semis, or Chelsea 2009 and 2012 semis, he did practically nothing, he was neutralized pretty easily. So if Barca shined then Messi also shined, but if Barca had troubles than Messi would disappear.Same for World Cups. In 2014 I don't remember him being pivotal in any of the important matches. His performance in 2014 was a far cry from Maradona's 86 performance, where the guy literally dribbled past everybody like in PlayStation game.So for me Maradona was something else.",Reddit

Since then its slowly declined in terms of talent for whatever reason. It seems like club football has risen in that time period, which is why this is a good time to make a revamped club world cup. I honestly believe that as long as the prize money isnt a rip off then teams all over will take this very seriously. Small teams definetly do take the current CWC seriously, with the new format we will see European teams do the same im sure of it. The mere fact that its every 4 years will make it huge. Im genuinely upset that Liverpool will not be involved in it.I believe this will become a global spectacle and well see everybody talking about it. I think the oppurtunity for non European teams to show off their skills will get people excited. As an American ill be very excited to see Seatlle sounders represent the usa, and im sure people from other countries will be very excited to see their own nations represented. You just know that any time a European club gets knocked out by somebody itll be an earthquake of excitement.

Both of them have an outstanding club career, in that regard no one in history can match their club success. Sadly they didn't deliver in the International level for a long period, and that has been a big a stain in their resumé. Such as I have considered both of them to be out of the top 5 of all time. But now finally we have a Messi performance in the World Cup. He is carrying Argentina 🇦🇷 to the triumph. He is their tactical leader as always, but this time for the first time he is their mental leader as well. Everybody in the team is focused, because Messi is making them believe in the Win. He usually lacked the maturity to make the team follow him. He has been a burden in 2018 for example, because he was weak mentally, visible stressed and visible scared of the World Cup. The same burden that Portugal 🇵🇹 suffered from Ronaldo during this World Cup. (Keep in mind that I have favored Ronaldo in the Messi/Ronaldo debate up till prior this World Cup).    Messi's greatness doesn't stop at mentally helping and focusing the team, but he has inspired a whole nation and maybe more to fly across half of the globe to support him and his team in such numbers that whenever Argentina 🇦🇷 plays it feels like they are playing at home. At this point, even if they lose in the final Messi should be regarded as the greatest of all time, period. Better than Pelé, better than Maradona, better than Zidane, better than Ronaldo the brazilian, better than Cruyff. He has achieved everything at club level and exceeded everything that others have done. Only one thing was missing, a big performance in the biggest stage of all, the World Cup, to be more precise, a Messi performance at the tough stages of the World Cup. To elevate his team tactically and mentally. He did it in this World Cup. In 2014 he wasn't doing what he is doing today.   Bottom line for me: Messi is the Undisputed Greatest Player of All Time, and we don't need to wait Sunday to say it. He is the GOAT today.",Reddit
36,Why does everyone hate england in football?,chaos_birb6,2023/08/24,https://www.reddit.com//r/football/comments/1600cix/why_does_everyone_hate_england_in_football/,"i wasn't aware of this at all growing up, but during my time on the internet i've found that almost everyone who's not from here hates us, even when there's not an established footballing rivalry between us and their respective countries like there is with germany and argentina. I've seen some pretty stupid things being said by people, e.g. ""i love seeing the pain and suffering of english fans"", ""if england won an international competition it would ruin the entire sport"", ""english people don't know how to play football"", etc etc, and also people pointing out obvious injustices against england (prime example would be the hand of god) as ""legendary moments in football's history"".Why? We've only won one trophy ever and barely had any success or luck, so what's everyone's problem with us? Football was invented in england and we're home to the oldest football league in the world, so you're wrong if you think england winning a trophy will be bad for the sport.

37,Why do English football fans like to diss Scottish football so much?,curlywurrly,2024/01/07,https://www.reddit.com//r/football/comments/190pcib/why_do_english_football_fans_like_to_diss/,"I saw the video of an English journalist asking Ange Postecoglou if he could 'visualise winning trophies' (as if none of his previous trophies counted) and then read the comments, which were filled with people dissing Scottish football, so I wondered why a lot of English football fans feel the need to do this.Obviously everyone is entitled to their opinion, but us Scottish fans know the standard isn't as good as the English Premier League, but we don't care, so what do you get out of telling us so?It's like a kid born into a rich family who goes to Eton slagging off a kid who goes to public school for not getting the same standard of education. Do you not realise how elitist it sounds?The thing is though, apart from Liverpool and Man Utd, most of your clubs would struggle to even finish 3rd in Scotland (if you had the same budgets as us, of course).Here's a few facts about our 'famers' league':- Scotland has the highest attendances in Europe per capita.- Ibrox holds the record for the largest league attendance in Britain.- Ibrox and Celtic Park were voted 1st and 2nd out of 100 by Four Four Two magazine for the best stadiums in Britain.- Hampden holds the record for the largest international attendance in Britain.- The highest UEFA club attendance ever was at Hampden.- In the last 4 seasons Scottish clubs have beaten: Porto, Galatasaray, Dortmund, Feyenoord, Lazio, Leipzig, PSV, Betis, AZ Alkmaar, Red Star, Braga, Rennes, Frankfurt, and Rosenborg (a list that most English teams would be proud of).I'm not slagging English football, I'm sure most Scots support the British clubs in Europe, but the next time you think your 'nan could win the league in Scotland', please give us a break and remember many English players and managers (as well as other top internationals) have come up here and either struggled or failed completely.Also, we've all seen the videos of the crap atmospheres at Anfield, Old Trafford, Tottenham and Man City lately, and at least we still don't have half 'n' half scarves for tourists, and most of us are glad our clubs haven't sold out to oil money and the Super League.Please don't take this as anti-English or any of that pish, I'm just trying to highlight how much of a bratty Eton schoolboy you sound when you feel the need to tell us how bad our game is. We already know and we don't care what you think about it. 👍🤣",Reddit

39,Why Haaland deserves the ballon d’or way more than Messi,OakeyCat,2023/07/11,https://www.reddit.com//r/football/comments/14wci2w/why_haaland_deserves_the_ballon_dor_way_more_than/,"The 2023 ballon d’or has 2 main candidates to win it, Lionel Messi and Erling Haaland. And if you think that Messi deserves it more than Haaland, you must be a  Messi fan.Firstly, let’s look at achievements. Messi had a great season at PSG, winning Ligue 1 and getting a plethora of goals and assists. He also won throphee des champions with PSG. But lets just remember, this is the French league, widely considered to be a farmers league and these achievements would put Messi nowhere near the competition to win the ballon d’or. However, the main (and, to be fair, only) reason that Messi is the number one candidate is his World Cup win. Messi carried Argentina to win both the World Cup and the golden ball (given to the best player of the tournament). This was no doubt a highlight of Messi’s career, but should I entirely change the course of the ballon d’or? On the other hand, Haaland has definitely had a far better season than Messi. He broke the premier league goal scoring record, scoring the most goals in one season ever (in the PL). On top of this, he carried city to win the fa cup, premier league and (for the first time in history for city) the champions league, claiming the golden boot in all of these competitions. This was all done in his first season btw. And on top of all this, he won the award for the best player in the premier league in the 22/23 season. To me, there is no competition here, Haaland has had a better season and has accomplished much more than Messi. The only other argument against Haalands ballon d’or win is his performance in the semi finals and finals of big competitions, failing to  score in these finals. But this doesn’t mean he played bad. Haaland created chances, applied pressure and was an incredible driving force in cities victories in these finals. Messi, on the other hand, had a stellar performance in the World Cup semiS and the final, scoring 3 goals and getting an assist. Whilst Messi do doubt had a better performance in the big games of big competitions, I still believe Haaland should win the ballon dor as he played in and helped his team to win both the biggest competition in Europe and the biggest tournament in England whereas Messi only played in the world cup and was nowhere to be found in the champions league. Overall, although Messi has had an unbelievable season and won the World Cup, the shouldn’t be the main factor in overruling haalands spectacular season and various achievements. Although this may just be my opinion, I think it should be obvious to use all that Haaland should win the ballon dor, and if Messi wins, we can truly rule out the people and reporters deciding as bias.",Reddit
40,"""Pele can't be the best because he didn't play in Europe""",diegoles7,2023/01/11,https://www.reddit.com//r/football/comments/1097a40/pele_cant_be_the_best_because_he_didnt_play_in/,"We have always heard/read that phrase and it is almost never contextualised. I clarify that the intention of this post is not to put Pelé as the number 1 but to destroy all those pseudo-arguments that people who don't know about football usually say. Of course there are plenty of arguments to argue that Pelé is the best player in history, as there are for some others, but that's not the idea of the post.In Pele's time, unlike today, it was not so common for South American players to go and play in Europe, there was still no Bosman law, so the best players from South America stayed in their respective leagues. Of course, there were some South Americans who played in Europe, but they were rare exceptions. The difference between the South American and European leagues was not as great as it is today. In fact, between 1958 and 1970, Brazil won 3 World Cups, that is to say, 3 out of 4. And all their players played in the Brazilian league. Moreover, the Brazilian league also had defenders like the Chilean Elías Figueroa, one of the best in his position at the time and always praised by Beckenbauer.The Intercontinental of the time was won mainly by South Americans and, in fact, Pelé won two, one against Eusebio's Benfica and the other against Milan. In addition, Santos toured Europe and smashed the Europeans with Pelé starring in the matches, scoring goals of all colours. It is true that they were friendlies, but at that time friendlies did not have the same meaning as they do now. Nowadays friendlies are used to test players in most cases, in those days they were not. They were played with a lot of rigour, as if it were an official match. Besides, everyone wanted to beat Santos, who at that time were the best team in the world. So there wasn't much difference between playing in Europe and playing in South America.Another pseudo-argument I want to destroy. Well, it's not even a pseudo-argument, it's a lie, it's a fallacy... I've read a lot of people saying that in Pele's time there was no such thing as offside. This is something that really pisses me off. Offside is more than 100 years old and in Pele's time it was even stricter, because if the blue team player was on the same line as the red team player, it was considered offside, nowadays that is not offside. Imagine how many more goals Pele would have scored with today's offside rule. And instead of giving him more credit, the opposite happens, they make fun of him saying that he counts the goals he scored at school. Counting friendlies he scored more than 1000 goals (many of them to Europeans). Officially he scored more than 700, now I don't have the exact figure. The fact is that he scored a lot of goals.Obviously, like everything in life, football has evolved, nowadays it is more tactical and so on, but you also have to take into account that in Pele's time there were not all those facilities that footballers have today. The ball in his time was heavy, as were the boots, the grass... Well, in many cases there wasn't even grass, they played on a muddy pitch. And another thing, there were no cards, in fact cards only existed after the 66 World Cup, when Pelé got injured. It wasn't until the 1970 World Cup that cards were introduced. Today, on the other hand, talented players are looked after, while Pelé was kicked to death, taking advantage of the fact that there were no cards. And even with all that going against him, Pelé was by far the best player in the world at the time.The post as I said at the beginning is not intended to put Pele as the number 1 in history, that in the end ends up being a matter of taste. I simply wanted to give him the credit he deserves. PS: Sorry if I have made any mistakes in the English translation.",Reddit

I've got myself in a spot of bother with the wife. This is a bit of a long story, so bare with me. I love football, before I met my wife I'd watch it all the time, mostly Premier League, Championship but lots of European football as well, African Cup of Nations when it's on, J-League, MLS, A-League, Chinese Super League, literally anything. My wife is not so keen, when we first lived together she was not happy with how much time I spent watching football on TV or the internet and demanded I cut down. It all came to a bit of a head during the Euros and we reached an agreement and I'm now at about 5 matches a week, which I guess is fair enough. She is important too.However, for a World Cup, I don't want to miss anything, I want to watch literally every match, either live or replay it later in the day. So one night, a few months back, I mentioned this to her and we agreed that I could, as long as I take her on holiday to whichever country wins the tournament. At this point I was probably a bit drunk and fairly confident England would win it. I was thinking great, we'll go have a weekend in Manchester, do some shopping, go to some nice bars and go watch one of the best teams in the world while we're there. Perfect.She starts getting into it, even watching matches and she's proper cheering on distant, exotic countries like Brazil, Japan, Australia. She's thinking big, we've not had a holiday since we married because of Covid and whatever. I'm still very much banking on a cheaper holiday in England, but then, obviously, England got knocked out and we're left with 4 teams in the semis:France - This is probably the best case scenario. She's mentioned Paris before and we can hop on the Eurostar or whatever. Should be nice, not going to cost me a bomb and I can probably go to Parc de Princes too.Croatia - Not too keen. I went there on a stag weekend a few years ago and it wasn't great. At least there's Dinamo Zagreb are some nice beaches but she'll probably want to drag me round Game of Thrones places.Morocco - I've heard good things about the food. I've not really looked into it but I'm not sure there would be that much to do and I imagine it would be way too hot. On the plus side, I imagine it would be relatively cheap.Argentina - This doesn't really bare thinking about, in terms of cost. At least I could probably go see some matches in Buenos Aries, there's supposed to be 24 professional teams in one city, which is pretty awesome, could visit each of the grounds.Of course, now it's between France and Argentina. My wife mentioned a week in Monaco the other day but I remembered some legal challenge, looked it up and was able to tell her Monaco isn't France and she seemed interested in the Paris option. She's started looking at Argentina and is thinking Buenos Aries, ranches, waterfalls, maybe go down to the very South to see some penguins. Trip of a lifetime sort of stuff but nothing I'm really interested in besides the football. I have no plan to back out though and I'm sure wherever we go, it will be a lot of fun for both of us, but my bank account and I will definitely be cheering on France!Throwaway account.",Reddit

Think mbappe is a good player don’t get me wrong, but personally without the speed / pace he isn’t all that special. I see chance after chance with that front three and mbappe misses chances that top scorers wouldn’t normally miss. He’s fairly good on the ball and finishing is decent but I feel like most of his goals are coming from him just being able to run into free space and create an opportunity. Obviously that’s a skill in itself so he’s still a top player but I’m putting his main ability as his insane pace. What do you guys think? Side note - not a religious football fan and don’t watch PSG games unless it’s champions league(do watch their highlights). I keep up to date with football and watch prem games and I think there’s far better strikers atm but all the hype is on mbappe. (Can’t lie I am a bit of a haaland fan though!)Edit - the whole point was to ask people with probably better knowledge of PSG who actually watch them play. I’ve acknowledged that he has incredible pace and he obviously utilises it, but the point is everyone acts like he’s world class and the next best thing but in reality if he loses that pace due to age / injury what has he got left? His dribbling and finishing is good but not incredible and he misses chances a world class player wouldn’t miss. Basically I think he’s overrated and wanted opinions from people who watch him play for 90 mins - like I said I don’t 🤷‍♂️",Reddit

This work was conducted in close collaborationwith Tottenham Hotspurs FC (THFC), the PGA European tour and the participationof Wolverhampton Wanderers (WW).  Three investigations were conducted:  1. Predicting the recovery time of football injuries using the UEFA injuryrecordings: The UEFA recordings is a common standard for recording injuries inprofessional football. For this investigation, three datasets of UEFA injuryrecordings were available. Different machine learning algorithms were used inorder to build a predictive model. The performance of the machine learningmodels is then improved by using feature selection conducted throughcorrelation-based subset feature selection and random forests.  2. Predicting injuries in professional football using exposure records: Therelationship between exposure (in training hours and match hours) inprofessional football athletes and injury incidence was studied. A commonproblem in football is understanding how the training schedule of an athletecan affect the chance of him getting injured. The task was to predict thenumber of days a player can train before he gets injured.  3. Predicting intrinsic injury incidence using in-training GPS measurements:A significant percentage of football injuries can be attributed to overtrainingand fatigue. GPS data collected during training sessions might provideindicators of fatigue, or might be used to detect very intense trainingsessions which can lead to overtraining. This research used GPS data gatheredduring training sessions of the first team of THFC, in order to predict whetheran injury would take place during a week.",Arxiv

Machine learning,a form of artificial intelligence (AI), uses algorithms to detect meaningfulpatterns and define a structure based on positional data. This researchinvestigates a new method to evaluate the value of current football players,based on establishing the machine learning models to investigate the relationsamong the various features of players, the salary of players, and the marketvalue of players. The data of the football players used for this project isfrom several football websites. The data on the salary of football players willbe the proxy for evaluating the value of players, and other features will beused to establish and train the ML model for predicting the suitable salary forthe players. The motivation is to explore what are the relations betweendifferent features of football players and their salaries - how each featureaffects their salaries, or which are the most important features to affect thesalary? Although many standards can reflect the value of football players, thesalary of the players is one of the most intuitive and crucial indexes, so thisstudy will use the salary of players as the proxy to evaluate their value.Moreover, many features of players can affect the valuation of the footballplayers, but the value of players is mainly decided by three types of factors:basic characteristics, performance on the court, and achievements at the club.",Arxiv

We do so using only the thirty-year record of whichvisiting teams played which home teams, on what date, and what the final scorewas. No real ""statistics"" are used. The method works best in basketball, likelybecause it is high-scoring and has long seasons. It works better in footballand hockey than in baseball, but in baseball the predictions are closer to atheoretical optimum. The football predictions, while good, can in principle bemade much better, and the hockey predictions can be made somewhat better. Thesefindings tells us that in basketball, most statistics are subsumed by thescores of the games, whereas in football, further study of game and playerstatistics is necessary to predict games as well as can be done.

Instead, a goodeffective description of the data is provided by less basic distributions suchas the negative binomial one or the probability densities of extreme valuestatistics. To understand this behavior from a microscopical point of view,however, no waiting time problem or extremal process need be invoked. Instead,modifying the Bernoulli random process underlying the Poissonian model toinclude a simple component of self-affirmation seems to describe the datasurprisingly well and allows to understand the observed deviation from Gaussianstatistics. The phenomenological distributions used before can be understood asspecial cases within this framework. We analyzed historical football score datafrom many leagues in Europe as well as from international tournaments,including data from all past tournaments of the ``FIFA World Cup'' series, andfound the proposed models to be applicable rather universally.

From the concept, a Binary Classification problem is created whereby aprobabilistic valuation is outputted using Logistic Regression and GradientBoosting based approaches. The model successfully predicts xGs probabilityvalues for football players based on 15,575 shots. The proposed solutionutilises StatsBomb as the data provider and an industry benchmark to tune themodels in the right direction.

However, the field division approach isoversimplified because all locations within a region are regarded as uniformherein. The objective of the current study is to propose a fundamentalframework for space evaluation based on field weighting.

Most existing models of football player motion have not beenvalidated yet with respect to actual data. One of the reasons for this lack isthat performing such a validation is not straightforward, because models ofplayer motion are usually phrased in a way that emphasises possibly reachablepositions rather than expected positions. Since positional data of footballplayers typically contains outliers, this data may misrepresent the range ofactually reachable positions.  This paper proposes a validation routine for trajectorial motion models thatmeasures and optimises the ability of a motion model to accurately predict allpossibly reachable positions by favoring the smallest predicted area ofreachable positions that encompasses all observed reached positions up to amanually defined threshold. We demonstrate validation and optimisation on fourdifferent motion models, assuming (a) motion with constant speed, (b) motionwith constant acceleration, (c) motion with constant acceleration with a speedlimit, and (d) motion along two segments with constant speed. Our results showthat assuming motion with constant speed or constant acceleration without alimit on the achievable speed is particularly inappropriate for an accuratedistinction between reachable and unreachable locations. Motion along twosegments of constant speed provides by far the highest accuracy among thetested models and serves as an efficient and accurate approximation ofreal-world player motion.",Arxiv

Matthews",2023/05/17,http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10262v3,"In American football, a pass rush is an attempt by the defensive team todisrupt the offense and prevent the quarterback (QB) from completing a pass.Existing metrics for assessing pass rush performance are either discrete-timequantities or based on subjective judgment. Using player tracking data, wepropose STRAIN, a novel metric for evaluating pass rushers in the NationalFootball League (NFL) at the continuous-time within-play level. Inspired by theconcept of strain rate in materials science, STRAIN is a simple andinterpretable means for measuring defensive pressure in football. It is adirectly-observed statistic as a function of two features: the distance betweenthe pass rusher and QB, and the rate at which this distance is being reduced.Our metric possesses great predictability of pressure and stability over time.We also fit a multilevel model for STRAIN to understand the defensive pressurecontribution of every pass rusher at the play-level. We apply our approach toNFL data and present results for the first eight weeks of the 2021 regularseason. In particular, we provide comparisons of STRAIN for different defensivepositions and play outcomes, and rankings of the NFL's best pass rushersaccording to our metric.",Arxiv
155,A network-based ranking system for American college football,"Juyong Park, M. E. J. Newman",2005/05/24,http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0505169v4,"American college football faces a conflict created by the desire to stagenational championship games between the best teams of a season when there is noconventional playoff system to decide which those teams are. Instead, rankingof teams is based on their record of wins and losses during the season, buteach team plays only a small fraction of eligible opponents, making the systemunderdetermined or contradictory or both. It is an interesting challenge tocreate a ranking system that at once is mathematically well-founded, givesresults in general accord with received wisdom concerning the relativestrengths of the teams, and is based upon intuitive principles, allowing it tobe accepted readily by fans and experts alike. Here we introduce aone-parameter ranking method that satisfies all of these requirements and isbased on a network representation of college football schedules.",Arxiv
156,Self-affirmation model for football goal distributions,"Elmar Bittner, Andreas Nussbaumer, Wolfhard Janke, Martin Weigel",2007/05/18,http://arxiv.org/abs/0705.2724v1,"Analyzing football score data with statistical techniques, we investigate howthe highly co-operative nature of the game is reflected in averaged propertiessuch as the distributions of scored goals for the home and away teams. It turnsout that in particular the tails of the distributions are not well described byindependent Bernoulli trials, but rather well modeled by negative binomial orgeneralized extreme value distributions. To understand this behavior from firstprinciples, we suggest to modify the Bernoulli random process to include asimple component of self-affirmation which seems to describe the datasurprisingly well and allows to interpret the observed deviation from Gaussianstatistics. The phenomenological distributions used before can be understood asspecial cases within this framework. We analyzed historical football score datafrom many leagues in Europe as well as from international tournaments and foundthe proposed models to be applicable rather universally. In particular, here wecompare men's and women's leagues and the separate German leagues during thecold war times and find some remarkable differences.",Arxiv
