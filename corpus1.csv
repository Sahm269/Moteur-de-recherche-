2,Messi was NOT the best player last season and/or year,thesadhra,2023/10/26,"I know the Messi defence brigade will come out of their holes to justify this decision but honestly at this point I don‚Äôt care. Messi obviously one of the best players of all time but in no way was Messi better than Haaland last season. Outside of the WC Messi was outshined by Mbappe within the same league and he got dogwalked by Bayern in the UCL. If Messi went to the premier league and in his very first season broke the prem goal record, was top scorer in the UCL and went ahead and won the clubs first ever treble then he would have won the Ballon D‚Äôor regardless of whatever happened in the WC. The people calling for him to win the award now will still be wanting him to win it then. Let‚Äôs face it the award is massively biased and is nothing more than a popularity contest. Messi and others have robbed people in the past and they‚Äôll continue to do so in the future.",Reddit

Vicario was awesome, Hojberg, Porro and the rest of the guys, that's a team, more so than most other teams. At the beginning of the season, I doubted this team, but this Tottenham side is different from all the others IMO, they have more capacity to actually win titles, they shouldn't see this result as a failure, neither should the fans, even as a neutral, it was difficult not to support them.

16,Has Messi just spoiled football standards forever? ( not blaming him ü§£),Artetaarmy,2023/09/03,"Messi is in the top 0.0000001% of all time in all offensive attributes. Passing, dribbling, shooting, playmaking and visually pleasing on the eye as well and he's been doing this for almost 15 years week in and week out ffs.Previously we had players who were best at one or two of these things but this is where Messi is different from others. He's one of a kind imo. If you said to a football fan in 1990s that there will be a player who will be the best passer, dribbler and he would score almost a goal a game as well, they would laugh probably. But Messi has made it a reality. Now anyone who dares to touch his legacy has this near impossible task ahead and I legit think that even the likes of mbappe, haaland and future players will not feel really special to fans(apart from their club and country fans obv)anymore since they  have witnessed Messi already and that's what I meant by Messi spoiling the standards.What do you guys think?",Reddit

Lewandowski had an amazing year. But unfortunately for lewa fans, Messi outperformed him this year.   Here's why:  **Winning Copa America**  No matter who you are, you've got to appreciate what Messi has done for his country this year. And you've got to feel happy for the man. This guy just deserved it. Here are the pointers:  * Ended a 28 year trophy drought for his country* Player of the Tournament* Top Goal scorer* Top Assist provider* Absolutely killed it. Seriously the guy was so good. One of the best performances at international level if not the best.   **Winning Cop del Rey**  This is something a lot of people are neglecting. Copa del Rey is pretty competitive. It's not a very easy trophy. But Messi won it!   But here's the part what in my opinion is **the biggest reason** why he deserves it.   Barca are a mess right now without Messi. Lat year, they one the Copa del Rey, and this year Barca isnt even able to qualify for the the Knockout stage of the champions league!!!   This just shows how much Messi carried Barca last year and took them to great heights.   >!Yes I know there was also Griezmann who left the club, but lets be honest. If you watched the games you know much he was involved. !<  **Stat Sheet**  A lot of people are using the stats to prove that Lewa deserved it. But they are just calculating the G/A.   If that were the deciding factor, our man, Leo would have won like 9 golden balls!   Please compare the Stat sheet. Messi leads in every category except Goals scored. >!Ignore Benzema here guys. Sorry. !<The Stat sheet speaks for itself. https://preview.redd.it/qvpggxkv4n281.jpg?width=843&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b2b8a1c82fb90594aa877467c866a1f2b8034df9I rest my case there.

They're so heavily dependent on oil that they may be in trouble by the 2030s/40s with depleting resources, so now they're just spending a tonne on mega projects and their football leagues while they actually can.(And yes they're also aiming to pivot to other sources of income but weaning a whole economy off of heavy oil use is hard).Just a thought but its an interesting explainer as to why this all seems to be happening right now.",Reddit

Some of the things you hear from this fanbase is utterly ridiculous. Calling for the managers head when he hasn't even had a full camp with the squad or 2 transfer windows.

21,Peak Maradona was better than peak Messi,Welder-Tall,2022/01/17,"This is not an easy debate. It's hard to compare 2 players.  Overall one may say Messi had a better career than Maradona. More goals, more personal and team titles, Messi was also more professional, much more consistent, he didn't do stupid stuff like Maradona, like drugs, fights, parties, lack of discipline and so on.&#x200B;But for me peak Maradona was a beast. In 1986 WC he was simply taking opponent teams apart on his own, dribbling past 3-4 players and scoring goals or creating chances.Peak Messi was a great  player too. I really liked the young Messi, at age 18-21, when he was also very fast and strong, and could terrorize whole defense on his own. But in his mid 20's his game changed. He became slower, and focused primarily on scoring goals from chances created by Barca team play. Usually in big matches he was easily neutralized, he didn't carry the team. Like against Inter in 2010 semis, or Chelsea 2009 and 2012 semis, he did practically nothing, he was neutralized pretty easily. So if Barca shined then Messi also shined, but if Barca had troubles than Messi would disappear.Same for World Cups. In 2014 I don't remember him being pivotal in any of the important matches. His performance in 2014 was a far cry from Maradona's 86 performance, where the guy literally dribbled past everybody like in PlayStation game.So for me Maradona was something else.",Reddit

25,Unpopular opinion: The new club world cup will be a spectacle,sufinomo,2023/12/19,"Only having it every 4 years is all they needed to do in order to sell me on it. The world cup is special because its every four years, simple as that. If it was every year it would lose alot of its relevance. I started watching soccer in 2006, and back then the wc felt huge. Since then its slowly declined in terms of talent for whatever reason. It seems like club football has risen in that time period, which is why this is a good time to make a revamped club world cup. I honestly believe that as long as the prize money isnt a rip off then teams all over will take this very seriously. Small teams definetly do take the current CWC seriously, with the new format we will see European teams do the same im sure of it. The mere fact that its every 4 years will make it huge. Im genuinely upset that Liverpool will not be involved in it.I believe this will become a global spectacle and well see everybody talking about it. I think the oppurtunity for non European teams to show off their skills will get people excited. As an American ill be very excited to see Seatlle sounders represent the usa, and im sure people from other countries will be very excited to see their own nations represented. You just know that any time a European club gets knocked out by somebody itll be an earthquake of excitement. This is very good for the sport, itll help grow non European football leagues interest because itll feel more relevant to win these competitions that qualify you. ",Reddit

Anderson",2020/07/21,"A detailed understanding of foot morphology can enable the design of morecomfortable and better fitting footwear. However, foot morphology varies widelywithin the population, and changes dynamically during the loading of stancephase. This study presents a parametric statistical shape model from 4D footscans to capture both the inter- and intra-individual variability in footmorphology. Thirty subjects walked on a treadmill while 4D scans of their rightfoot were taken at 90 frames-per-second during stance phase. Each subject'sheight, weight, foot length, foot width, arch length, and sex were alsorecorded. The 4D scans were all registered to a common high-quality foot scan,and a principal component analysis was done on all processed 4D scans.Elastic-net linear regression models were built to predict the principalcomponent scores, which were then inverse transformed into 4D scans. The bestperforming model was selected with leave-one-out cross-validation. The chosenmodel was predicts foot morphology across stance phase with a root-mean squarederror of 5.2 +/- 2.0 mm. This study shows that statistical shape modeling canbe used to predict dynamic changes in foot morphology across the population.The model can be used to investigate and improve foot-footwear interaction,allowing for better fitting and more comfortable footwear.",Arxiv

29,f2IMU-R: Pedestrian Navigation by Low-cost Foot-Mounted Dual IMUs and  Inter-foot Ranging,"Maoran Zhu, Yuanxin Wu, Shitu Luo",2020/12/08,"Foot-mounted inertial sensors become popular in many indoor or GPS-deniedapplications, including but not limited to medical monitoring, gait analysis,soldier and first responder positioning. However, the foot-mounted inertialnavigation relies largely on the aid of Zero Velocity Update (ZUPT) and hasencountered inherent problems such as heading drift. This paper implements apedestrian navigation system based on dual foot-mounted low-cost inertialmeasurement units (IMU) and inter-foot ultrasonic ranging. The observabilityanalysis of the system is performed to investigate the roles of the ZUPTmeasurement and the foot-to-foot ranging measurement in improving the stateestimability. A Kalman-based estimation algorithm is mechanized in the Earthframe, rather than in the common local-level frame, which is found to beeffective in depressing the linearization error in Kalman filtering. Anellipsoid constraint in the Earth frame is also proposed to further restrictthe height drift. Simulation and real field experiments show that the proposedmethod has better robustness and positioning accuracy (about 0.1-0.2% travelleddistance) than the traditional pedestrian navigation schemes do.",Arxiv

The 3Dfoot scanning system was employed to obtain static footprints from subjectsadopting a half-weight-bearing stance. Based upon their footprints, thesubjects were divided into two groups: the flat-footed and the high-arched. Theplantar pressure measurement system was used to measure and record thesubjects' successive natural gaits. Two indices were proposed: distribution ofvertical ground reaction force (VGRF) of plantar and the rate of the footprintareas. Using these two indices to compare the natural gaits of the two subjectgroups, we found that (1) in stance phase, there is a significant difference(p<0.01) in the distributions of VGRF of plantar; (2) in a stride cycle, thereis also a significant difference (p<0.01) in the rates of the footprint areas.Our analysis suggests that when walking, the VGRF of the plantar brings greatermuscle tension to the flat-footed while a smaller rate of the footprint areasbrings greater stability to the high-arched.",Arxiv

With this aim, 20 young healthy adults were askedto stand as immobile as possible in two conditions of No fatigue and Fatigue oftrunk extensor muscles. In Experiment 1 (n = 10), somatosensation from the footand the ankle was degraded by standing on a foam surface. In Experiment 2 (n =10), somatosensation from the foot and ankle was facilitated through theincreased cutaneous feedback at the foot and ankle provided by strips ofathletic tape applied across both ankle joints. The centre of foot pressuredisplacements (CoP) were recorded using a force platform. The results showedthat (1) trunk extensor muscles fatigue increased CoP displacements undernormal somatosensatory conditions (Experiment 1 and Experiment 2), (2) thisdestabilizing effect was exacerbated when somatosensation from the foot and theankle was degraded (Experiment 1), and (3) this destabilizing effect wasmitigated when somatosensation from the foot and the ankle was facilitated(Experiment 2). Altogether, the present findings evidenced re-weighting ofsensory cues for controlling posture during quiet standing following trunkextensor muscles fatigue by increasing the reliance on the somatosensory inputsfrom the foot and the ankle.

The ability of the PTT to restore foot alignment ina collapsed foot was evaluated by increasing the PTT force in a foot withattenuated ligaments and comparing the alignment angles to the intact foot.Rupture of any one of the ligaments led to overloading the remaining ligaments,except for the plantar naviculocuneiform, first plantar tarsometatarsal, andspring ligaments, where removing one led to unloading the other two. Theattenuation of the plantar fascia, long plantar, short plantar, and springligaments significantly overloaded the deltoid and talocalcaneal ligaments.Isolated PTT rupture had no effect on foot alignment, but did increase theforce in the deltoid and spring ligaments. Increasing the force within the PTTto 30% of body weight was effective at restoring foot alignment during quietstance, primarily through reducing hindfoot valgus and forefoot abduction asopposed to improving arch height. The attenuation of any one ligament oftenleads to overload of the remaining ligaments which may lead to progressivedegeneration. The PTT can maintain alignment in the collapsing foot, but at anincreased load which could lead to its injury. Early intervention, in the formof ligament repair or reconstruction, might be used to prevent the progressionof deformity. Moreover, strengthening the PTT through therapeutic exercisemight improve its ability to restore foot alignment.",Arxiv

Weekend days do not show apeaked structure, but rather increase steadily until sunset. Our study periodof June 28, 2017 to September 11, 2017 contains two holidays, the 4th of Julyand Labor Day, and their foot traffic patterns are quantitatively similar toweekend days despite the fact that they fell on weekdays. Projecting all daysin our study period onto the weekday/weekend phase space (by regressing againstthe average weekday and weekend day) we find that Friday foot traffic can berepresented as a mixture of both the 3-peak weekday structure and non-peakedweekend structure. We also show that anomalies in the foot traffic patterns canbe used for detection of events and network-level disruptions. Finally, we showthat clustering of foot traffic time series generates associations betweencameras that are spatially aligned with Manhattan neighborhood boundariesindicating that foot traffic dynamics encode information about neighborhoodcharacter.",Arxiv

40,Learning Agile Locomotion and Adaptive Behaviors via RL-augmented MPC,"Yiyu Chen, Quan Nguyen",2023/10/13,"In the context of legged robots, adaptive behavior involves adaptivebalancing and adaptive swing foot reflection. While adaptive balancingcounteracts perturbations to the robot, adaptive swing foot reflection helpsthe robot to navigate intricate terrains without foot entrapment. In thispaper, we manage to bring both aspects of adaptive behavior to quadrupedlocomotion by combining RL and MPC while improving the robustness and agilityof blind legged locomotion. This integration leverages MPC's strength inpredictive capabilities and RL's adeptness in drawing from past experiences.Unlike traditional locomotion controls that separate stance foot control andswing foot trajectory, our innovative approach unifies them, addressing theirlack of synchronization. At the heart of our contribution is the synthesis ofstance foot control with swing foot reflection, improving agility androbustness in locomotion with adaptive behavior. A hallmark of our approach isrobust blind stair climbing through swing foot reflection. Moreover, weintentionally designed the learning module as a general plugin for differentrobot platforms. We trained the policy and implemented our approach on theUnitree A1 robot, achieving impressive results: a peak turn rate of 8.5 rad/s,a peak running speed of 3 m/s, and steering at a speed of 2.5 m/s. Remarkably,this framework also allows the robot to maintain stable locomotion whilebearing an unexpected load of 10 kg, or 83\% of its body mass. We furtherdemonstrate the generalizability and robustness of the same policy where itrealizes zero-shot transfer to different robot platforms like Go1 and AlienGorobots for load carrying.

Since one legof a quadruped robot typically only has 3 actuated degrees of freedom (DoFs),the torso is employed to assist foot posture control via a hierarchicalwhole-body controller. The foot and torso postures are controlled by twoanalytical Cartesian impedance controllers cascaded by a null space projector.The contact forces acting on supporting feet are optimized by quadraticprogramming (QP). The foot's Cartesian impedance controller may also estimatecontact forces from trajectory tracking errors, and relay the force-feedback tothe operator.

The mechanics and energetics of running innatural terrain, particularly on surfaces that can yield and flow under stress,is less understood. The zebra-tailed lizard (Callisaurus draconoides), a smalldesert generalist with a large, elongate, tendinous hind foot, runs rapidlyacross a variety of natural substrates. We use high speed video to obtaindetailed three-dimensional running kinematics on solid and granular surfaces toreveal how leg, foot, and substrate mechanics contribute to its high locomotorperformance. Running at ~10 body length/s (~1 m/s), the center of massoscillates like a spring-mass system on both substrates, with only 15%reduction in stride length on the granular surface. On the solid surface, astrut-spring model of the hind limb reveals that the hind foot saves about 40%of the mechanical work needed per step, significant for the lizard's smallsize. On the granular surface, a penetration force model and hypothesizedsubsurface foot rotation indicates that the hind foot paddles through fluidizedgranular medium, and that the energy lost per step during irreversibledeformation of the substrate does not differ from the reduction in themechanical energy of the center of mass. The upper hind leg muscles mustperform three times as much mechanical work on the granular surface as on thesolid surface to compensate for the greater energy lost within the foot and tothe substrate.",Arxiv

One critical limitation of current interfaces is that they aredesigned to be operated by only the hands. This means that the surgeon can onlycontrol at most two robotic instruments at one time while many interventionsrequire three instruments. This paper introduces a novel four-degree-of-freedomfoot-machine interface which allows the surgeon to control a third roboticinstrument using the foot, giving the surgeon a ""third hand"". This interface isessentially a parallel-serial hybrid mechanism with springs and force sensors.Unlike existing switch-based interfaces that can only un-intuitively generatemotion in discrete directions, this interface allows intuitive control of aslave robotic arm in continuous directions and speeds, naturally matching thefoot movements with dynamic force & position feedbacks. An experiment with tennaive subjects was conducted to test the system. In view of the significantvariance of motion patterns between subjects, a subject-specific mapping fromfoot movements to command outputs was developed using Independent ComponentAnalysis (ICA). Results showed that the ICA method could accurately identifysubjects' foot motion patterns and significantly improve the predictionaccuracy of motion directions from 68% to 88% as compared with the forwardkinematics-based approach.

However, they often introduce artefacts in motions, whichcan be detrimental to the perceived realism. In particular, footskating is afrequent and disturbing artefact requiring foot contacts knowledge to becleaned up. Current approaches to obtain foot contact labels rely either onunreliable threshold-based heuristics or on tedious manual annotation. In thisarticle, we address foot contact label detection from motion with a deeplearning. To this end, we first publicly release UnderPressure, a novel motioncapture database labelled with pressure insoles data serving as reliableknowledge of foot contact with the ground. Then, we design and train a deepneural network to estimate ground reaction forces exerted on the feet frommotion data and then derive accurate foot contact labels. The evaluation of ourmodel shows that we significantly outperform heuristic approaches based onheight and velocity thresholds and that our approach is much more robust onmotion sequences suffering from perturbations like noise or footskate. Wefurther propose a fully automatic workflow for footskate cleanup: foot contactlabels are first derived from estimated ground reaction forces. Then, footskateis removed by solving foot constraints through an optimisation-based inversekinematics (IK) approach that ensures consistency with the estimated groundreaction forces. Beyond footskate cleanup, both the database and the method wepropose could help to improve many approaches based on foot contact labels orground reaction forces, including inverse dynamics problems like motionreconstruction and learning of deep motion models in motion synthesis orcharacter animation.

We employ thedispersion to analyze the effect of the time of the initial foot contact thatimposes upon these physical quantities. Our study reveals that when the time ofone foot's initial contact falls right in the middle of the other foot's stridecycle, these physical quantities reach extrema.

48,Effect Of Running Shoes on Foot Impact During Running,Henry Nassif,2016/09/07,"Running is part of almost every sport, and requires a great amount ofstamina, endurance, mental toughness and overall strength. At every step, thefoot experiences ground reaction forces necessary to support the motion of thebody. With the advancements in shoe technology, running shoes have grown inpopularity among runners, as well as non-runners, because they reduce the riskof injuries from the impact felt by the foot. The purpose of this report is toanalyze the effect of running shoes on impact forces on the foot. This isachieved through the use of three force pads fixed at different locations onthe foot The force measured by each sensor is then used to estimate thevertical ground reaction force, using the sensors' calibrations equations .Based on the ground reaction force, the effective mass corresponding to themomentum change occurring during the transient phase of the impact isestimated. The results show that running at 9 miles per hour without runningshoes generates an effective mass of (14.9 +/- 4.8)% of the total body mass,while running at the same speed with running shoes generates an effective massof (7.8 +/- 1.5 )% of the total body mass.

Basedon the observational results, we propose that the prominence should be composedof an overlying horizontal spine encircling a low-lying horizontal and avertical foot, in which the horizontal foot was consisted of shorter fieldlines running partially along the spine and with the both ends connecting tothe solar surface, while the vertical foot was consisted of piling-up dips dueto the sagging of the spine fields and supported by a bipolar magnetic systemformed by parasitic polarities (i.e., the bubble). The upflows in the verticalfoot were possibly caused by the magnetic reconnection at the separator betweenthe bubble and the overlying dips, which intruded into the persistent downflowfield and formed the picture of counter-streaming mass flows. In addition, thecounter-streaming flows in the horizontal foot were possibly caused by theimbalanced pressure at the both ends.",Arxiv
